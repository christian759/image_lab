        The application provides a user-friendly interface for editing images, 
        allowing users to apply filters, resize images, adjust brightness/contrast, and more. 
        
        Here's a detailed overview of its features and implementation:
        Features:
        
        Upload Image:
            Allow users to upload images from their local computer.
            Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.
    
        Display Image:
            Display the uploaded image for preview and editing.    
    
        Resize Image:
            Change the dimensions of the image.
            Maintain aspect ratio option.
    
        Colour adjustment:
            Adjust the colour of the image using sliders.
    
        Cropping:
            Allow users to select a region of the image to crop.
    
        Image Rotation:
            Rotate the image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
    
        Download Edited Image:
            Provide an option to download the edited image.

            An app that performs arithmetic operations on images can be designed to allow 
            users to combine images in various ways using mathematical operations such as 
            addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This can be useful for tasks
